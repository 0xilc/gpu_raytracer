## Objectives

Ray tracing is a fundamental rendering algorithm commonly used in animations and architectural simulations. The objective of this project is to implement a ray tracer that works on GPU to achieve real-time ray tracing results.

## Features

- **BVH Algorithm:** Accelerate ray-triangle intersection tests using the BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) algorithm for improved performance.
